Testing the 2nd file
so a code line means you want to open the file and add code lines into it.
if it says cd it mean change directory
if it says pwd it means print working directory
if it says mkdir is make directory
if it says rmdir or rm or rm -f it means to remove
the ~ can indicate the home directory
the git commands I have been using are git add, git status, git commit
Unsure of more, am cool to only revise these ones so far : ) hahaha jajaja 11 am i right AoE gamers ijbol fmd
